If we call `loss.backward()` multiple times before running `optimizer.step()` and `optimizer.zero_grad()`, then PyTorch accumulates (sums) the gradients, effectively merging the signal from several batches to give a single (better) estimate which is then used to update the parameters. This results in fewer total updates being made, just like we'd see if we used a larger batch size. This is something many frameworks will handle for you (for example, [🤗 Accelerate makes this easy](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/gradient_accumulation)) but it is nice to see it implemented from scratch since this is a useful technique for dealing with training under GPU memory constraints!

        "**Consideration 5:** It is often hard to tell how well fine-tuning is working, and what 'good performance' means may vary by use-case. For example, if you're fine-tuning a text-conditioned model like stable diffusion on a small dataset you probably want it to **retain** most of its original training so that it can understand arbitrary prompts not covered by your new dataset, while **adapting** to better match the style of your new training data. This could mean using a low learning rate alongside something like exponential model averaging, as demonstrated [in this great blog post about creating a pokemon version of stable diffusion](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/how-to-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-how-we-made-the-text-to-pokemon-model-at-lambda). In a different situation, you may want to completely re-train a model on new data (such as our bedroom -> wikiart example) in which case a larger learning rate and more training makes sense. Even though the [loss plot](https://wandb.ai/johnowhitaker/dm_finetune/runs/2upaa341) is not showing much improvement, the samples clearly show a move away from the original data and towards more 'artsy' outputs, although they remain mostly incoherent.\n",

        "- Fine-tuning looks just like training from scratch, except that by starting from an existing model we hope to get better results more quickly\n",
        "- To fine-tune large models on big images, we can use tricks like gradient accumulation to get around batch size limitations\n",
        "- Logging sample images is important for fine-tuning, where a loss curve might not show much useful information\n",
        "\n",
        "To put this into practice, here are some specific next steps you can take:\n",
        "- Fine-tune your own model and push it to the hub. This will involve picking a starting point (e.g. a model trained on [faces](https://huggingface.co/google/ddpm-celebahq-256), [bedrooms](https://huggingface.co/fusing/ddpm-lsun-bedroom), [cats](https://huggingface.co/fusing/ddpm-lsun-cat) or the [wikiart example above](https://huggingface.co/johnowhitaker/sd-class-wikiart-from-bedrooms)) and a dataset (perhaps these [animal faces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggan/AFHQv2) or your own images) and then running either the code in this notebook or the example script (demo usage below).\n",
        "- Explore guidance using your fine-tuned model, either using one of the example guidance functions (color_loss or CLIP) or inventing your own.\n",
        "- Share a demo based on this using Gradio, either modifying the [example space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/johnowhitaker/color-guided-wikiart-diffusion) to use your own model or creating your own custom version with more functionality.\n",
